============
Special Tags
============

Because of the simplistic approach to the telnet protocol we have used special
tags to add additional functionality.  These tags when used will not show up
as tags on your data but, will trigger the functionality they define.

**kairos_opt.ttl** This tag allows you to specify the ttl (time to live) for the data point.
The value must be a number greater or equal to zero.  Zero or no ttl is the default.
