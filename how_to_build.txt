Building requires JDK 1.6 or later.

To build set your classpath to the tablesaw jar file like so:
>export CLASSPATH=tools/tablesaw-1.0.4.jar

Then to build type
>java make

The first build will trigger build.sh so that the dependencies can be
downloaded.  After this you will need to build again.

You can also get help on what targets are available by typing
>java make help
