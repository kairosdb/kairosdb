Building requires JDK 1.8 or later.

To build set your classpath to the tablesaw jar file like so:
>export CLASSPATH=tools/tablesaw-1.2.8.jar

Then to build type
>java make package

You can also get help on what targets are available by typing
>java make help

If you prefer to use docker you can easily run the following commands from the top folder of this repository:
>docker build -t kairosdb:1.3.0_beta1 .
>docker run -it --rm -p 0.0.0.0:8080:8080 -p 0.0.0.0:4242:4242 kairosdb:1.3.0_beta1
